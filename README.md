# advance-go
a public stats collector using osu's public api v2

this is inspired by my javascript repository [Advance](https://github.com/calemy/advance) that was maintained [here](https://github.com/osuAdvance/advance)

I want this version to be open-sourced. It takes a lot of storage to store all of the data. With current caluclations i expect to have about 300 million scores saved in the database this year. I cannot really make any predictions beyond that yet. Please use with caution.

The database used for this project is postgresql.

Contributions are welcomed and i try to take the time to look at every issue and PR properly.
